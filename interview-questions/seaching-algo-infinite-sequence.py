# You are given an Infinite sequence of the form "121321432154321654321785432187654321 which consists of blocks of all positive integers written one after the another. The first block consists of numbers from 1 to 1, the second block consists of numbers from 2 to 1,.. the third block consists of numbers from 3 to the block will consist of numbers from ito 1...the ith block will consist of numbers from i to 1. Here the sequence is considered as 1 base Indexing.

# You will be given on Integer K and you have to find a digit at index K in the infinite sequence.
# * sequence: 121
# * Input: 3
